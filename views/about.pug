          p Hi, I'm Desiree. I'm entering the world of software development from the restaurant industry.
          | While managing a restaurant is fun (and challenging!), I've finally found my passion in software engineering.
          | When I'm not behind my laptop, you'll most likely find me in the gym, playing games with friends, or cooking in the kitchen.
          | Thanks for checking out my portfolio!
